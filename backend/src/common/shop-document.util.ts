 *
 * Intended to be called with a Prisma transaction client (`tx`) so document
 * rows are created atomically alongside the Shop/User/Subscription rows.
 * File-system writes themselves aren't part of the DB transaction (disk I/O
 * can't be rolled back), but that's an acceptable trade-off shared by every
 * upload-then-persist flow in this codebase (see CustomerService for the
 * same pattern with customer documents).
