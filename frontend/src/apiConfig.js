// Run). So VITE_API_BASE_URL must be set at build time to the live Render
// backend URL, e.g. https://kee-dopg.onrender.com, and every request is

// Triggers a real file download rather than a page/tab navigation.
//
// Earlier version of this fetched the file as a blob first (await
// fetch(...).blob()) and clicked a blob: link afterwards. That broke on
// mobile browsers: fetching a blob first introduces an async gap between
// the user's tap and the click(), and most mobile browsers only allow
// download-triggering actions within the synchronous call stack of the
// original user gesture — once that gap exists, the browser falls back to
// just opening/viewing the file instead of downloading it.
//
// The fix for the *web* build is a plain, synchronous <a> click (no await
// beforehand) so it stays inside the gesture, combined with the backend
// sending `Content-Disposition: attachment` on these URLs (see
// file.service.ts and main.ts) — that HTTP header is what actually forces
// a save-to-device across every browser, same-origin or not, rather than
// relying on the HTML `download` attribute (which browsers ignore
// cross-origin anyway).
//
// Inside the packaged Android app (Capacitor), that same <a href> click is
// a top-level WebView navigation to a cross-origin URL. Capacitor's
// WebViewClient has no DownloadListener wired up and, unless the target
// origin is explicitly allow-listed, blocks the navigation outright — this
// is what surfaced to users as "Download redirects to a Chrome error
// page." Fetching over the WebView is also unreliable for the Firebase
// Storage-backed URLs. So on native platforms we bypass the WebView
// entirely: Filesystem.downloadFile() uses the native OS HTTP stack (not
// subject to WebView navigation rules or page-level CORS) to fetch the file
// into the app's private cache dir, then the native SaveToDownloads plugin
// (android/app/src/main/java/com/kee/app/SaveToDownloadsPlugin.java) copies
// it straight into the device's public Downloads folder - so tapping
// Download actually downloads the file immediately, the same way a browser
// download would, without the user having to go through a share sheet and
// manually pick a save target.
//
// On Android 10+ this needs no permission prompt at all (it uses the
// scoped-storage MediaStore.Downloads API, which Google designed to not
// require one). On Android 9 and below it requests the classic
// WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission the first time - the native plugin
// handles that prompt itself.
